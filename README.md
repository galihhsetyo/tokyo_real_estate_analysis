# Tokyo Real Estate Analysis

I am working on a SQL project that analyzes real estate transactions in Tokyo. 
This is a project I did for my portfolio, where I intend to become a Data Analyst. 

- Data was taken from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism of Japan
- The dataset is a record of real estate transaction prices in Tokyo Prefecture, Japan from 2005 to 2019
- The project was built on MySQL
